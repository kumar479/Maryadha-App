# Sample Request Tracking Guide

This guide explains how to use the `sample-request-tracking-template.csv` spreadsheet to monitor sample activities and performance metrics.

## Spreadsheet Columns

- **Factory Name** – manufacturing partner providing the sample.
- **Brand Name** – requesting brand.
- **Sample ID** – unique identifier for each sample request.
- **Rep Name** – Maryadha representative managing the request.
- **Current Status** – current stage (e.g., `requested`, `in_review`, `approved`, `shipped`).
- **Last Action Taken** – brief note about the most recent update.
- **WhatsApp Group** – `Y` or `N` to indicate if a group was created.
- **Notes/Comments** – any additional context.

## Usage

1. Copy `docs/templates/sample-request-tracking-template.csv` to your preferred location (Google Sheets, Excel, or Notion).
2. Log every new sample request within 24 hours of receipt.
3. Update the **Current Status** and **Last Action Taken** columns as progress is made.
4. Use filtering in your spreadsheet to view requests by **Rep Name** or **Current Status**.
5. Review the sheet during weekly meetings to ensure all requests are up to date.

Admins should verify that reps keep records current and that all columns are filled in.
